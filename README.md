# ✔️ E-life(e) – Habit Tracker

> 🚧 This is a template repository for student project in the course Programming Foundations at FHNW, BSc BIT.  
> 🚧 Do not keep this section in your final submission.

This project is intended to:

- Practice the complete process from **problem analysis to implementation**
- Apply basic **Python** programming concepts learned in the Programming Foundations module
- Demonstrate the use of **console interaction, data validation, and file processing**
- Produce clean, well-structured, and documented code
- Prepare students for **teamwork and documentation** in later modules
- Use this repository as a starting point by importing it into your own GitHub account.  
- Work only within your own copy — do not push to the original template.  
- Commit regularly to track your progress.

## 📝 Analysis

**Problem**
> 🚧 Describe the real-world problem your application solves. (Not HOW, but WHAT)

💡 In a busy life style, the users don't have much time to track their in the making daily habits. This causes them not having an overview on their daily habit goals.

**Scenario**
> 🚧 Describe when and how a user will use your application

💡  E-life(e) helps in the part of the problem where users, by answering quick and easy questions on their habits, automatically generate a daily/weekly clear overview..

**User stories:**
1. As a user, I want to track my daily habits.
2. As a user, I want to select options for answers.
3. As a user, I want to be reminded of my goals
4. As a user, As a user, I want an overview to be created and saved.

**Use cases:**
- Show Menu (from `menu.txt`)
- Create Order (choose pizzas)
- Show Current Order and Total
- Print Invoice (to `invoice_xxx.txt`)

## ✅ Project Requirements

Each app must meet the following three criteria in order to be accepted (see also the official project guidelines PDF on Moodle):

1. Interactive app (console input)
2. Data validation (input checking)
3. File processing (read/write)

---

### 1. Interactive App (Console Input)

> 🚧 In this section, document how your project fulfills each criterion.  
---
The application interacts with the user via the console. Users can:
- View all the habits 
- Select habit and answer the question 
- See the results of each habit - Receive a daily/weekly overview of the habits

---


### 2. Data Validation - to be done later

The application validates all user input to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience. This is implemented in `main-invoice.py` as follows:

- **Menu selection:** When the user enters a pizza number, the program checks if the input is a digit and within the valid menu range:
	```python
	if not choice.isdigit() or not (1 <= int(choice) <= len(menu)):
			print("⚠️ Invalid choice.")
			continue
	```
	This ensures only valid menu items can be ordered.

- **Menu file validation:** When reading the menu file, the program checks for valid price values and skips invalid lines:
	```python
	try:
			menu.append({"name": name, "size": size, "price": float(price)})
	except ValueError:
			print(f"⚠️ Skipping invalid line: {line.strip()}")
	```

- **Main menu options:** The main menu checks for valid options and handles invalid choices gracefully:
	```python
	else:
			print("⚠️ Invalid choice.")
	```

These checks prevent crashes and guide the user to provide correct input, matching the validation requirements described in the project guidelines.

---


### 3. File Processing - to be done later

The application reads and writes data using files:

- **Input file:** `menu.txt` — Contains the pizza menu, one item per line in the format `PizzaName;Size;Price`.
	- Example:
		```
		Margherita;Medium;12.50
		Salami;Large;15.00
		Funghi;Small;9.00
		```
	- The application reads this file at startup to display available pizzas.

- **Output file:** `invoice_001.txt` (and similar) — Generated when an order is completed. Contains a summary of the order, including items, quantities, prices, discounts, and totals.
	- Example:
		```
		Invoice #001
		----------------------
		1x Margherita (Medium)   12.50


		2x Salami (Large)        30.00
		----------------------
		Total:                  42.50
		Discount:                2.50
		Amount Due:             40.00
		```
		- The output file serves as a record for both the user and the pizzeria, ensuring accuracy and transparency.

## ⚙️ Implementation

### Technology
- Python 3.x
- Environment: GitHub Codespaces
- OpenAI
- No external libraries

### 📂 Repository Structure
```text
PizzaRP/
├── main.py             # main program logic (console application)
├── menu.txt            # pizza menu (input data file)
├── invoice_001.txt     # example of a generated invoice (output file)
├── docs/               # optional screenshots or project documentation
└── README.md           # project description and milestones
```

### How to Run
> 🚧 Adjust if needed.
1. Open the repository in **GitHub Codespaces**
2. Open the **Terminal**
3. Run:
	```bash
	python3 main.py
	```

### Libraries Used

- `os`: Used for file and path operations, such as checking if the menu file exists and creating new files.
- `glob`: Used to find all invoice files matching a pattern (e.g., `invoice_*.txt`) to determine the next invoice number.

These libraries are part of the Python standard library, so no external installation is required. They were chosen for their simplicity and effectiveness in handling file management tasks in a console application.
